there was once a little boy. He loved to play chess. He learnt how to play chess from a custodian at his boarding school. His talents got noticed by a chess club leader from a highschool. He took him to compete against all of the players at once in a single game. The boy beat all of them. He later got taken from his orphanage to a new home. There he went to school but there was no chess club.
